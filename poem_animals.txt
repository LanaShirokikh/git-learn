I love my cat.
It is warm and fat.
My cat is grey.
It likes to play.

I have a little turtle,
He lives in a box.
He swims in the water
And he climbs on the rocks.

My dog can’t talk
But he can bark!
I take my dog
And go to the park!

The cow says: Moo, moo…
I have some milk for you and you.

A duckling is a little duck.
A chicken is a little cock.
A kitten is a little cat.
A puppy is a little dog.
