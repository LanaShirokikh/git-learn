The leaves are falling
One by one.
Summer’s over
School’s begun.

Snow on the ground.
Snow on the tree.
Snow on the house.
Snow on me!

During Spring, it often showers.
Or the sun shines for many hours.
Both are good for the flowers!

In summer I like to play outside.
In summer I like to go to the seaside.
I like to pick up shells,
To put them on the shelf.
